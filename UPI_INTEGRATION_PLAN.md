Phase 1 – MVP (Now)


Users manually add expenses.


Option to upload UPI statement file (CSV/PDF) in future; for now we simulate UPI data.


Only insights and education, no payments.


Phase 2 – Read-only UPI (Post-funding)


Integrate with partners like Setu / Decentro for UPI transaction APIs (RBI-compliant, read-only access).


Pull transactions, categorize, and show patterns.


Still no wallet; money always stays with the bank/UPI apps.


Phase 3 – Investing & deeper banking (Later)


Work with SEBI-registered brokers for micro-investing for 15–25 year olds with parental KYC where required.


Possible teen card / wallet via licensed BaaS partners.
